Challenge6 - Recursion, See?

Due: Monday, April 11 @ 8pm. You have approx. two weeks to complete this challenge for 100%, 
with additional regrades (<100%) after that.

There are three recursive problems and one sarcastic Ninja 
as part of this MP so please start early. 

Good luck and have fun!
Need help? There's office hours and Piazza in case you get stuck.

Bill and the CS125 staff. 

Overview:
This assignment will hone your recursion and debugging skills. 
You'll be working on three recursive problems and one debugging problem:

Firstly, you'll see a linked list class. We'll use this class to link words together.
You will need to complete the given recursive instance methods and one non-recursive class method.

Secondly, you'll be working with a slightly more complex data structure: a family tree.

Finally, you'll be writing a recursive algorithm to perform a complex Gene Sequencing Analysis problem.
This is not as hard as it appears - the recursive description is very close to the required Java code.

Each of these recursive problems are discussed in the Task files. Each problem has it's own set of test cases and a single file that you need to modify.

And watch out for the Debugger Ninja. There are four graded debugging methods.
You have the source code of each Ninja method. Your challenge is to step through the code using the debugger
to determine the correct starting value. 

Be careful - An incorrect value leads to sarcasm and insults from the Ninja.

Grading & Submission:
Ensure that your modified BlackBeltDebuggerChallenge,LinkedList.java,Person.java and GeneAnalysis.java are committed back to subversion before the deadline.
You can check your expected score by running the java file  "AutomaticGrader.java"
Remember that your final version may not contain *any* compile errors.
(Check the problems, also there will be a red mark against the filename in the package view) 

You can debug your programs by running the unit tests individually and/or using the debugger to step through your code.
Efficient solutions will run fairly quickly - it should be pass all tests in a few seconds.
If your tests are passing but take minutes then check to see if you can reduce
the number of times you make a recursive call. Perhaps you can cache the result
in a temporary result instead?

Do's and Dont's
Commit code that has no compile errors.
You need to type in all of the code yourself.
Don't share your electronic files for others to use - that's cheating.
