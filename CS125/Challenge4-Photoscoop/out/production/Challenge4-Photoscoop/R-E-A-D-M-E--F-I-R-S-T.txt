Hi there,
Here's the almost-finished 'Photoscoop' application that we hope to embed into every advanced camera phone next year.
The idea is that we'll give away a free version now with just some basic features then users can pay to use more features
(e.g. working with movie files).

By the way, run the playlists in the debugger so that you can find and fix the infinite loop!

I've already built the basic structure of the application - menus/ loading/saving etc but I need you to actually implement the photo effects.
I've ABSTRACTED out the details of how Java represents images in screen: Your effects methods just work with 2D integer arrays.

There are some missing features and possibly a bug or two in my GUI part - but dont worry I'll get these done before tomorrow's investor meeting & demo.
At some point I'll add a mask functionality so that your effects only get applied to part of the image.However as the effects code only
sees 2D arrays, I can add this in later and we wont need to change any of your code.
Also I cut some corners in programming style - I used static methods whenever possible; there's no class that represents an image document yet.

One of the 'cool' features that the bloggers wanted was redeye reduction and chroma key (see wikipedia) built into this application.

By the way, pay attention to the javadoc comments- /** blah blah */ 
that are immediately before each method:
They contain useful notes about what the method should do.

Best,
Your dot-com startup partner.
ps. sorry I can't help today - I'll be at a meeting with the bank to setup payroll and checking.
pps. The other programmer quit (he got too confused about column and row indices when rotating images)
pppps Suggest you draw it on a piece of paper. [0][0] is the top left


IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Your challenge is to implement the following photo effects:

# resize - resize a picture (2D int array) to a given width or height, or ii) to the same width,height of a another array.
The new picture may be larger or smaller than the original.
# half   - half the size of the picture. Create a new array of half the width and height and populate accordingly.
# merge  - independently merge the red values of the source and background, the green and the blue.
The output should be the same size as the input. Scale (x,y) values when reading the background
(e.g. so the far right pixel of the source is merged with the far-right pixel ofthe background).
# rotate - Rotate the picture CCW (counter-clockwise).
# flip   - Flip the picture vertically, along a horizonal axis.
# mirror - Mirror the picture along a vertical axis.
# key    - Perform a chroma key assuming a green background.
If the image has a different size than the background use the resize() method to change it to be equal to the background size.
# funky  - This should do something novel and interesting (you need to decide what it should be)

The code for each of these effects are static methods inside PixelEffects.java
Note there are two resize methods; only one of the them needs to have  loops!
- One resize method can delegate the work to the other one.

I've created a redeye reduction effect but it wont work until you've implemented the toRed, toGreen methods etc.

To make undo work we also need a copy() method that creates a deep copy of the source array.
i.e. The source and the copy are completely independent.

***************************************************
The 2D arrays are arrays of arrays of integers
int [][]picture;

picture[0][0] represents the top-lefthand corner.
picture.length is the width of the picture (in pixels)
picture[0].length is the height of the picture (in pixels).
Each integer entry e.g. picture[25][28] is an integer representation of the color of one screen pixel.
***************************************************

You will need to edit the following files:
# PixelEffects.java - the effect methods described above. This class should delegate extracting red/green/blue values to the methods inside RGBUtilities.

# Effects.java - A simple if-else method that acts as the glue between the menus and the actual processing methods.
Note this method should delegate all of its pixel processing work to methods inside PixelEffects.
This method is just a large number of if-else statements that connect the menu item to each of the methods inside pixeleffects.

# PlayListUtil.java - A set of class methods to manipulate lists.

# RGBUtilities.java

This class holds the methods to convert between individual red,green,blue values and single integer representation of the color.
Each red,green or blue component can have a value between 0 (dark) and 255(fully on).
i.e. each component uses 8 bits of information.

This is where base-16 'hexadecimal' 0,1,2,..9,A,B,C,D,E,F) becomes useful to describe different colors because each hex digit describes 4 bits of information.
So two digits are required to get values from 0..255: . 00 , 01, 02, 0F,10 ...F0, F1... FF (=255 in decimal).
This means we can read the red,green,blue color components directly from it's hexadecimal format.
For example, C044FF means red=C0 (192 out of 255), green=44 (68 out of 255) and blue=FF (255 out of 255).
So this color would be mostly blue, with some red and a small amount of green.

In Java, to tell the compiler that we want speak in hexadecimal we preface the number with 0x
e.g.
0x10 is 16 in decimal.
0x1000 is 256 * 16 in decimal
0x100000 is 256 * 256 * 16 in decimal

Here's some examples to show how writing a number in hexadecimal makes it easy to read- the red, green and blue component values:
e.g. 0x--ffffff implies red,green and blue are all at the maximum of 255 out of 255; completely white
e.g. 0x--ffff00 implies red,green are strongly on  but without any blue; bright yellow
e.g. 0x--808080 implies red,green and blue components are all half on; gray.
e.g. 0x--000000 implies red,green and blue are all off; black!

There's actually a fourth component (shown above as '--'); the 'alpha' channel. This is used in advanced image functions for transparency/opaqueness when combining images together.
For our purposes it gets in the way: The highest bit in a Java integer is used to represent the sign of the number. 
So if the alpha component has a value >= 0x80 then it turns the raw  color values negative.

The fix is to use bit operators: If we only want the lowest eight bits (-blue) use "& 255' to 'MASK' out the other unwanted bits.
If we want the green component, we need to shift the next eight bits to the right and then apply the same Mask trick. (look up <<)

Put this code into the RGBUtilities.toRed(),toGreen,toBlue methods and get it right once : then use these methods in your PixelEffects methods!

Re. Chroma Key - 
To pass the unit tests you just need to choose the background pixel whenever the source pixel is green.
However I suggest you experiment with the test images to find a good way to differentiate between green background and non-green in all of the test images.
Here's some ideas you might want to try - but feel free to improve on them /invent your own.

green > 100 and blue <100
green > max(blue,red)
green > (blue+red)
green > blue 

... You could combine them in some way or include additional numerical factors:
e.g. green > 32 && green < 250 && green < blue * 1.5;
... but it's upto you to find something that works for the various test images that we have.

DEVELOPMENT

To run the program run the class 'Photoscoop' and test your functions on the given images
To run the automated tests run the unit tests, or run GradeChallenge4.
It's useful to read the source code of the tests to see what they test.




* Submission, Grading and subversion (Same as before)

In the package window, right click on your java file and select TEAM> COMMIT... and complete the dialog that pops up.

You need to COMMIT your changes to the java files (RGBUtilities.java,Effects.java,PixelEffects.java,PlayListUtil.java) back to the subversion repository.
You may, but do not need to, make changes to any other files - for grading purposes we will only use the above four files.
You can commit your files multiple times - in fact we expect you to. (You can even go back to previous versions that you committed).

After the deadline we will grade the last version you committed BEFORE the deadline.

You can check that your solution is correct by running the automated unit tests (there is a testing file provided for each one).

You can run all the tests in one go: In the package window right click on 'default package' and select RUN AS... JUNIT TEST
You can run the autograder yourself: right click on AutomaticGrader and select RUN AS ... JAVA APPLICATION. This has the effect of
running all the unit tests and printing a score based on the number of tests passed.

As always there's Piazza and office hours. It helps to ask us questions well before the deadline. So get stuck early :-)
Regards,
Bill and the CS125 team.

Some hints:
PlayListUtil.java is the only part of this MP that is independent of Photoscoop. 
For the Photoscoop code we suggest you work on order RGBUtilities.java, PixelEffects.java, then Effects.java.
This is mostly because PixelEffects.java needs functions in RGBAUtilities.java 
and the test for Effects.java won't run properly until you've finished PixelEffects.java
Effects is just a bunch of if/else. Note you may need to print out the parameter value.
Stenography test is not hard if you understand bit shifts and masking
