Challenge3 - TopSecret

Due: Monday February 22th, 2016 8pm (1 week)

As the Julius Caesar's lead programmer for the Roman Empire (RE) you have the following programming task today:
* Write a program from scratch to help Jules encrypt and decrypt his military orders.
 - This task is described in CaesarCipher.txt
 
The four graded java files are:
* CaesarCipher (see instructions in CaesarCipher.txt)
* CipherBreaker (see instructions in CipherBreaker.txt)
* OddSum
* MagicEightBall

There's also several example classes to play with.

* Eclipse hints 

In the package view, if you change a file and have not yet committed the change :
Then, depending on your subversion plugin, either the icon will include a white star on a back background OR it will add a '>' before the name.
The white star or '>' will disappear once you have committed the file.


The most useful views (windows) are : Package, Console, Problems, JUnit and SVN Repository views.

* Getting help

Please use the class newsgroup. However please don't post solutions / correct code.

Use the TA office hours
NB It's a good idea to start early and get stuck early, rather than panic two hours before the deadline!
Good luck and have fun!

* What you will learn (Learning Objectives)

The purpose of these programming assignments is for you to learn following -
JAVA CORE KNOW-HOW:
# Format text output using TextIO put and putln methods.
# Read input from the keyboard using getln,getlnInt.
# Create and use String, int, boolean, double variables.
# Perform simple calculations using arithmetic operators.
# Use String instance methods length, charAt, concatenation
# Use integer arithmetic (characters as integers, modulus).
# Use loops and expressions to validate user input and process characters

PROGRAMMING CORE SKILLS:
# Translate program descriptions into a complete Java program.
# Use unit tests and manual testing as part of the development process.
# Use Eclipse Development environment to create, run, test and commit programs.
# Add comments and authorship
# Reverse engineering (reading Java unit test code and figuring out the specification & implementation)

RELEVANT BOOK SECTIONS: (http://math.hws.edu/javanotes)
From the previous assignment -
ch1.4 Fundamental Building Blocks of Programs
ch2.1 The Basic Java Application,
ch2.2 Variables and the Primitive Types
ch2.3 Strings, Objects, Enums, and Subroutines
ch2.4 Text Input and Output
COURSE NOTES (COURSE NOTES - https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/cs125/CourseNotes2006)

New for this assignment - 
ch3.1 Loops and Branches
ch3.3 while and do-while
ch3.4 for statement
ch3.5 If Statement 

* Submission, Grading and subversion (Same as before)

In the package window, right click on your java file and select TEAM> COMMIT... and complete the dialog that pops up.

You need to COMMIT your changes to the java files (CaesarCipher.java, OddSum.java,CipherBreaker.java,MagicEightBall.java) back to the subversion repository.
You may but do not need to make changes to any other files - for grading purposes we will only use the above four files.
You can commit your files multiple times - in fact we expect you to. (You can even go back to previous versions that you committed).

After the deadline we will grade the last version you committed BEFORE the deadline.

You can check that your solution is correct by running the automated unit tests (there is a testing file provided for each one).

You can run all the tests in one go: In the package window right click on 'default package' and select RUN AS... JUNIT TEST
You can run the autograder yourself: right click on AutomaticScoreCheck and select RUN AS ... JAVA APPLICATION. This has the effect of
running all the unit tests and printing a score based on the number of tests passed.

* Cheating
Learn by doing - 
Remember that you must *type* all of your code yourself; digitally copying another student's work is cheating.

You may post non-working code to the CS125 Piazza group to get help.
But you may not digitally send your working code to share with others. 

Have fun! -Bill & the CS125 Team
