Challenge5-Data Structures - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY - 

Due: Friday, March 18 @ 8pm. You have almost two weeks to complete this challenge
Note: There will be additional regrade opportunities.
BUT - make sure you know these concepts in two weeks for quiz opportunities

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Your challenge is to implement the following eight classes 
and become master of Stacks and Queues-

Geocache.java
GeocacheList.java
KeyValueMap.java
Queue.java
Stack.java
CallAStaticMethod.java
StaticMethodsAreEasy.java
UsingPublicFieldsIsEasy.java

- such that all of the unit tests pass and the AutomaticGrader gives you 100%.


HINTS
Useful and interesting example java code can be found in the 
ExampleDebugger, ExampleDoubleList and ExampleFileSearch classes.

When you first check this project out, you'll see some compile errors in the package view.
These will all need to be fixed (by creating the relevant classes and methods) to get an
MP score greater than 1/100.
StaticMethods and UsingPublicFields are the simplest.
and Geocache before LabeledGeocache and GeocacheList.
When writing each method, remember that other methods you have
already written may simplify the task in hand.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The purpose of these programming assignments is for you to learn following -

PROGRAMMING SKILLS & DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:
# Implement a data structures (list), without performance concerns.
# Use procedural abstraction and code-reuse to hide implementation details

* Submission, Grading and subversion (Same as before)

In the package window, right click on your java file and select TEAM> COMMIT... and complete the dialog that pops up.

You need to COMMIT your changes to the java files (back to the subversion repository.
For grading purposes any changes made to the test java files, TextIO or the Autograder will be ignored.
You can commit your files multiple times - in fact we expect you to. (You can even go back to previous versions that you committed).

You can check that your solution is correct by running the automated unit tests (there is a testing file provided for each one).

You can run all the tests in one go: In the package window right click on 'default package' and select RUN AS... JUNIT TEST
You should run the autograder yourself: right click on AutomaticGrader and select RUN AS Java Application. This has the effect of
compiling all java files and if there are no compile errors, running all the unit tests and printing a score based on the number of tests passed.
A submission with a compile error will score 1/100.
A submission with an infinite loop will score 0/100.

As always there's Piazza and office hours. It helps to ask us questions well before the deadline. So get stuck early :-)

Have fun and good luck!
Bill and the CS125 team.
